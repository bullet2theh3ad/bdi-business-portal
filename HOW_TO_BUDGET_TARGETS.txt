                       HOW TO USE BUDGET TARGETS SYSTEM
                           BDI Business Portal Guide
================================================================================

OVERVIEW
--------
The Budget Targets system allows you to set ESTIMATED/TARGET budget numbers
for projects and compare them against ACTUAL NRE Spend. This helps with:
- Budget planning and forecasting
- Variance analysis (over/under budget)
- Project cost control
- Executive reporting

KEY CONCEPT: TARGETS vs ACTUALS
--------------------------------
• BUDGET TARGETS = What you PLAN to spend (this system)
• NRE SPEND = What you ACTUALLY spent (separate system)
• VARIANCE = The difference between target and actual


ACCESS
------
Location: Admin → Budget Targets (in sidebar)
Required Role: Super Admin, Admin


================================================================================
CREATING A BUDGET TARGET
================================================================================

STEP 1: OPEN CREATE DIALOG
---------------------------
1. Click "Create Budget Target" button (top right, green)
2. The Create/Edit Budget Target modal opens


STEP 2: FILL BASIC INFORMATION
-------------------------------
All fields in the initial tab are REQUIRED:

1. Project Name* - REQUIRED
   - Name of the project this budget is for
   - Example: "MNQ15 Development", "RTC700 Certification"

2. SKU Code* - REQUIRED
   - Enter the product SKU this budget applies to
   - Example: "MNQ15-C", "RTC700"
   - System will match this against actual NRE Spend
   - IMPORTANT: Must match SKU in NRE Spend for variance analysis

3. Budget Category* - Select from dropdown:
   - TOTAL_BUDGET (default for initial estimate)
   - NRE (General)
   - NRE Design
   - Tooling
   - Samples (EVT/DVT/PVT)
   - Certifications
   - Field Testing
   - ODM Setup
   - Firmware
   - Application Software
   - And many more...

4. Budget Description - Optional
   - Additional context about this budget
   - Example: "Q1 2025 Development Budget"

5. Total Budget Amount* - REQUIRED
   - Enter your estimated/target spending amount
   - Example: 50000 (for $50,000)
   - This is what you PLAN to spend


STEP 3: SAVE BUDGET TARGET
---------------------------
1. Review information for accuracy

2. Click "Create Budget Target" button

3. Budget is saved and appears in the list

4. System will automatically calculate variance when actual NRE Spend exists


================================================================================
UNDERSTANDING THE DASHBOARD
================================================================================

SUMMARY CARDS
-------------
Top of page shows four key metrics:

1. TOTAL TARGET BUDGET
   - Sum of all budget targets
   - What you planned to spend across all projects

2. TOTAL ACTUAL SPEND
   - Sum of all actual NRE spending
   - What you've actually spent
   - Comes from NRE Spend system

3. TOTAL VARIANCE
   - Difference between target and actual
   - GREEN (positive %) = Under budget (good!)
   - RED (negative %) = Over budget (needs attention)
   - Formula: Target - Actual

4. BUDGET COUNT
   - Number of budget targets created
   - Number of actual NRE budgets matched


BUDGET TARGET CARDS
-------------------
Each target shows:

- Project Name
- SKU Code (used for matching)
- Budget Category
- Target Amount (what you planned)
- Actual Spend (what was actually spent)
- Variance:
  • Shows dollar amount difference
  • Shows percentage
  • Color coded: Green = under budget, Red = over budget
- Edit and Delete buttons


ACTUAL NRE BUDGETS SECTION (COLLAPSIBLE)
-----------------------------------------
Below targets, you'll see matched actual NRE Spend:

1. Click to expand/collapse section

2. Shows all NRE budgets that match your target's SKU Code

3. For each NRE budget, displays:
   - NRE Reference Number
   - Vendor Name
   - Total Amount
   - Payment Status
   - Payment Schedule details
   - Individual line items with:
     • Description
     • Category
     • Amount

4. This is how the system knows what you "actually" spent


================================================================================
EDITING A BUDGET TARGET
================================================================================

1. Click "Edit" button on any budget target card

2. Modal opens with existing data

3. You can change:
   - Project Name
   - SKU Code (be careful - affects variance matching)
   - Budget Category
   - Budget Description
   - Total Budget Amount

4. Click "Save Budget Target"

5. Variance recalculates automatically


================================================================================
DELETING A BUDGET TARGET
================================================================================

1. Click "Delete" button on budget target card

2. Confirm deletion in popup

3. Budget target is removed (soft deleted)

4. Does NOT affect actual NRE Spend data


================================================================================
VARIANCE ANALYSIS GUIDE
================================================================================

UNDERSTANDING VARIANCE
----------------------
Variance = Target Budget - Actual Spend

POSITIVE VARIANCE (Green)
- You spent LESS than planned
- Example: Target $50,000, Actual $45,000 = +$5,000 (10% under)
- Generally good news!

NEGATIVE VARIANCE (Red)
- You spent MORE than planned
- Example: Target $50,000, Actual $55,000 = -$5,000 (-10% over)
- Requires investigation

ZERO VARIANCE
- Perfect match between target and actual
- Rare but indicates accurate forecasting


HOW MATCHING WORKS
------------------
System matches Budget Targets to Actual NRE Spend by SKU Code:

1. You create a Budget Target for "MNQ15-C" = $50,000

2. System looks for NRE Budgets with SKU Code = "MNQ15-C"

3. Finds matching budgets:
   - NRE-ELC123ABC: $25,000 (Tooling)
   - NRE-ELC456DEF: $20,000 (Certifications)
   - Total Actual: $45,000

4. Calculates: $50,000 - $45,000 = +$5,000 variance (10% under)

5. Displays green indicator (under budget)


IMPORTANT: SKU CODE MUST MATCH EXACTLY
---------------------------------------
For variance analysis to work:
- Budget Target SKU: "MNQ15-C"
- NRE Spend SKU: "MNQ15-C" ✓ MATCH

Will NOT match:
- "MNQ15" vs "MNQ15-C"
- "MNQ15-C" vs "mnq15-c" (case sensitive)
- "MNQ15-C" vs "MNQ15 C" (space difference)


================================================================================
USING BUDGET TARGETS FOR PROJECT MANAGEMENT
================================================================================

INITIAL PROJECT SETUP
---------------------
When starting a new product:

1. Create a Budget Target for total estimated NRE
   - SKU Code: Enter product SKU
   - Category: TOTAL_BUDGET
   - Amount: Your total estimated spending

2. As project progresses, actual NRE costs get entered in NRE Spend system

3. Check Budget Targets page weekly to monitor variance


MID-PROJECT REVIEW
------------------
1. Review variance for each project

2. Green (under budget):
   - Great! Continue as planned
   - Consider if estimate was too conservative

3. Red (over budget):
   - Investigate why actual > target
   - Common causes:
     • Scope creep
     • Vendor price increases
     • Additional testing required
     • Timeline delays
   - Update target if justified
   - Or take corrective action on spending


END OF PROJECT
--------------
1. Final variance shows forecast accuracy

2. Use learnings for future project estimates

3. Export data for post-mortem analysis


================================================================================
BEST PRACTICES
================================================================================

1. CREATE TARGETS EARLY
   - Set targets BEFORE spending begins
   - Use initial vendor quotes as basis
   - Add contingency buffer (10-15%)

2. USE CORRECT SKU CODES
   - Must match exactly with NRE Spend entries
   - Check NRE Spend system for existing SKUs
   - Be consistent with format

3. SINGLE TARGET PER SKU
   - Create ONE total target per product
   - Avoid creating multiple overlapping targets
   - Simplifies variance tracking

4. REVIEW WEEKLY
   - Check variance every Monday
   - Act quickly on negative variances
   - Update stakeholders on status

5. UPDATE TARGETS WHEN APPROPRIATE
   - If project scope changes significantly
   - If approved budget increases
   - Document reason in Budget Description

6. MATCH CATEGORIES
   - Use same categories as NRE Spend
   - Makes drill-down analysis easier


================================================================================
REPORTING AND ANALYSIS
================================================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
-----------------
Use Summary Cards to report:

3. Add note in Budget Description: "Scope increase - added WiFi certification"
4. Variance recalculates
5. Communicate to stakeholders


SCENARIO 4: FORECAST TOO HIGH
------------------------------
Problem: Budgeted $100K, actually spent $75K
Solution:
1. Review why estimate was high
2. Document lessons learned
3. Use for future project estimates
4. Celebrate the savings!


================================================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

ISSUE: Variance shows $0 but I know we spent money
SOLUTION: Check SKU codes match exactly between target and NRE Spend
          Case sensitive, must be identical

ISSUE: Showing "over budget" but spending was approved
SOLUTION: Edit Budget Target and increase Total Budget Amount
          Add explanation in Budget Description

ISSUE: Cannot create Budget Target
SOLUTION: Ensure all required fields (*) are filled:
          • Project Name
          • SKU Code
          • Total Budget Amount

ISSUE: Too many targets, getting confusing
SOLUTION: Delete old/closed project targets
          Use clear Project Names
          Consider one target per active SKU

ISSUE: Actual NRE Budgets section is empty
SOLUTION: Ensure NRE Spend entries exist with matching SKU Code
          Create NRE Spend entries in NRE Spend system
