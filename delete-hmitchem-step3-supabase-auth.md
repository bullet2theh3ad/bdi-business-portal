# Step 3: Remove Hannah's Supabase Auth Record

Since SQL deletion of auth users is restricted, you need to use the Supabase Dashboard:

## Instructions:
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to **Authentication > Users**
3. Search for: `hannahjomitchem@gmail.com`
4. Find the user with ID: `17e44952-1809-49f9-846c-da94a5a25835`
5. Click the **Delete** button (trash icon) next to her record
6. Confirm the deletion

## After Deletion:
Hannah will be completely removed from your system and you can send her a fresh invitation to `hmitchem@boundlessdevices.com` (her correct work email).
