# URGENT: Fix "Too Many Clients" Database Error

## Problem
Error: `sorry, too many clients already` - Supabase database connection limit reached.

## Root Cause
The app is creating too many database connections without properly managing them. Supabase free tier has a limited number of concurrent connections (60-100).

## Solution Applied (Code Changes)

### 1. Updated `lib/db/drizzle.ts`
- Added connection pooling configuration
- Limited max connections to 10
- Set idle timeout to 20 seconds
- Disabled prepared statements for pooler compatibility

## CRITICAL: Vercel Environment Variable Update

### ⚠️ YOU MUST UPDATE THE DATABASE_URL IN VERCEL ⚠️

**Go to your Supabase Dashboard:**

1. Navigate to: **Project Settings** → **Database**
2. Look for **Connection Pooling** section
3. Copy the **Transaction Mode** connection string (Port 6543)
   - It looks like: `postgresql://postgres.xxx:[PASSWORD]@aws-0-us-west-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres`
   - **NOT** the direct connection (Port 5432)

**Update Vercel:**

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your project: **BDI Business Portal**
3. Go to: **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
4. Find: `DATABASE_URL`
5. **Edit** and replace with the **Transaction Mode pooler URL** (port 6543)
6. Important: Update for **ALL environments** (Production, Preview, Development)
7. Click **Save**
8. **Redeploy** your application

### How to Redeploy:
- Go to **Deployments** tab in Vercel
- Click the **3 dots** on the latest deployment
- Select **Redeploy**

## Why This Fixes It

1. **Connection Pooling**: Instead of opening a new connection for every request, the app will reuse a pool of 10 connections
2. **Transaction Mode (Port 6543)**: Supabase's pooler manages connections more efficiently
3. **Idle Timeout**: Closes unused connections after 20 seconds, freeing up resources
4. **Prepared Statements Disabled**: Required for transaction pooler compatibility

## Verification

After redeploying, check:
1. Login should work immediately
2. No more "too many clients" errors in Vercel logs
3. All pages load normally

## Alternative: Increase Supabase Plan (If needed)

If you still hit limits after this fix:
- Upgrade Supabase to Pro plan ($25/month)
- Pro plan allows up to 200 direct connections
- Better for high-traffic applications

## Notes

- Current fix limits concurrent DB operations to 10
- This is sufficient for most applications
- If you need more, consider upgrading Supabase plan
- The pooler connection string is in your Supabase dashboard under "Connection Pooling"
